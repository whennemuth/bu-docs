If you plan to run the docker host using docker-machine against the default minimal Linux VM (boot2docker) then:
1) download docker toolbox. https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/windows/
2) use this for extra documentation for below: https://docs.docker.com/machine/get-started/
2) open bash terminal
3) docker-machine create -- driver virtualbox mydockervm (ssh will be set up automatically)
4) docker-machine env mydockervm
5) to stop vm use: docker-machine stop mydockervm
   to start vm again use: docker-machine start mydockervm
6) get the ip of the VM: docker-machine ls
7) ssh into the VM (the default user is docker):
   eval `ssh-agent -s`
   ssh docker@[ip address of VM without the port number]
   enter the default password: tcuser
8) docker run -d -u root -p 80:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v /home/docker/jenkins:/var/jenkins_home jenkins
   (for more detail: https://hub.docker.com/_/jenkins/)
9) docker ps
   (will show running docker containers. You should see "jenkins" as one of them)
10) Type the VM ip address in a browser window url field and you should see the jenkins welcome page.

or...

If you plan to run docker using a host VM that you set up yourself then:
1) Install the docker.exe using the unofficial Windows package manager Chocolatey.
2) www.ubuntu.com/desktop --> download Ubuntu --> download 64 bit version of latest release. (this is a .iso file)
3) If virtualbox is not downloaded, get it from oracle.
4) Create a new virtual machine for linux 64 bit ubuntu.
   name = jenkinsvm
   memory = 1024 MB
   storage = 15 GB
5) start the new VM and when prompted for an iso to boot from, specify the iso downloaded from ubuntu.com
6) you will be prompted to create a super user and assign a password. This user should have root access.
   user = "warren"
   password = "password"
7) Add a host-only network adapter
   a) Select VM --> settings --> network --> select next empty adapter tab (probably "adapter 2")
      Attached to: "Host-only Adapter
      Name: VirtualBox Host-Only Ethernet Adapter
   b) Save and restart VM.
7) configure linux to listen on port 22 for ssh connections:
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install openssh-server
   sudo ufw allow 22
8) To share folders outside the VM and to get a better screen resolution, install virtual box linux additions.
   (details at: https://leemendelowitz.github.io/blog/ubuntu-server-virtualbox.html)
   Do the following steps from a terminal in the VM:
   a) First the gcc prerequisite:
      UBUNTU:
         sudo apt-get -y install gcc make linux-headers-$(uname -r)
      CENTOS:
         sudo yum update -y
         sudo yum install -y gcc kernel-devel make
   b) From the VirtualBox VM GUI window menu, select "Devices -> Insert Guest Additions CD Image..."
      This will insert the VirtualBox GuestAdditions installation CD into the VM's DVD drive
   c) UBUNTU:
         sudo mount /dev/sr0 /media/warren/VBOXADDITIONS_5.0.16_105871/
         you may get output saying "mount: /dev/sr0 is already mounted on /media/warren/VBOXADDITIONS_5.0.16_105871"
         if so, just go on to the next step.
      CENTOS:
         sudo mkdir /cdrom
         sudo mount /dev/cdrom /cdrom
   d) UBUNTU:
         sudo /media/warren/VBOXADDITIONS_5.0.16_105871/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
      CENTOS:
         sudo yum install -y bzip2
         sudo /cdrom/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
   e) Finally, add your user to the vboxsf group so you can access shared folders (in the VM):
      sudo usermod -g vboxsf warren
   f) In the VM, Devices --> Shared Folders --> Shared Folder Settings... --> Click the Add new share icon:
      "Folder Path:": Select a directory in you file system to mount to
      "Folder Name:": The name you type here will appear in the ubuntu file explorer as a shared folder with this name prepended with "sf_"
      check "Auto-mount"
      check "Make Permanent" 
9) Modify ssh access so the a private key can be used instead of a password:
   a) Make sure the VM is running.
   b) in the VM console, use ifconfig to determine the ip address the VM for the bridge network adapter created earlier.
   c) Bring up a bash terminal.
   d) cd ~/.ssh
   e) ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -v
      name the key "jenkins_vm_id_rsa"
      leave passphrase blank
   f) ssh-copy-id -i jenkins_vm_id_rsa.pub root@[ip address of VM]
   g) cat > /c/windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts <<EOF
      [ip address of VM]  jenkinsvm
      EOF
      (NOTE: since the VM ip is established with dhcp, it may change later on when restarting the VM, making it necessary to change it again in this hosts file after finding out what the new ip is. Attempts to make the VM ip a static ip failed).
   g) You should now be able to ssh in using:
      eval `ssh-agent -s`
      ssh-add C:/Users/wrh/.ssh/jenkins_vm_id_rsa
      ssh warren@jenkinsvm
   h) More info at http://www.beginninglinux.com/home/server-administration/openssh-keys-certificates-authentication-pem-pub-crt
10) Install docker on the VM:
    sudo curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
    usermod -aG docker warren (adds user warren to the docker group)
11) Run the docker container for jenkins:
    docker run -d -u root -p 80:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v /home/docker/jenkins:/var/jenkins_home jenkins
    By default, without an image name "jenkins" in the local docker repository, docker will search dockerhub for one of that name.
    It will find the standard docker jenkins image. However, this image is based off a dockerfile configured such that the internal /var/jenkins_home directory is considererd a volume.
    This will be the case whether or not you specify an external directory in the file system running docker that the volume is to be mounted to using the -v parameter of the docker run command.
    Notes on this within the jenkins docker file are:
       # Jenkins home directory is a volume, so configuration and build history 
       # can be persisted and survive image upgrades
       VOLUME /var/jenkins_home
    You should be able to visit the jenkins home page in the browser outside the VM: http://jenkinsvm
12) If you would prefer not to have to create a directory on the docker host to persist jenkins logs/jobs/plugins, etc through as a mounted volume, you can alternately mount to a docker data volume container.
    a) Remove dangling images:
       docker rmi -f $(docker images --filter dangling=true -q)
    b) Create a data volume as a separate container called "jenkins-dv":
       docker create -v /var/jenkins_home --name jenkins-dv jenkins
    c) Run the jenkins docker image using the --volumes-from switch to include the data volume container.
       docker run -d -u root -p 80:8080 -p 50000:50000 --volumes-from jenkins-dv --name jenkins-app jenkins
       (see: http://www.catosplace.net/blog/2015/02/11/running-jenkins-in-docker-containers/
             https://engineering.riotgames.com/news/docker-jenkins-data-persists)
    d) Goto http://jenkinsvm and add some blank jobs and/or load in a plugin(s).
    e) Stop the docker jenkins-app container (NOTE: the jenkins-dv is already stopped as it is only a data volume and does not run an app)
       docker stop jenkins-app
    f) Goto http://jenkinsvm and confirm that you get a 404
    g) Restart the jenkins-app container (NOTE: you do not need to include any of the switches and parameters made in the original run command that created the container - these are "stamped" into the container)
       docker restart jenkins-app
    h) Goto http://jenkinsvm and confirm you see the default page AND the jobs you created and plugins you loaded are still there.
13) If using a data volume container (jenkins-dv) as above, you can restart the jenkins-app container from a backup of it.
    a) sudo mkdir /home/docker/docker-dv-backups
    b) sudo chmod 777 /home/docker/docker-dv-backups
    c) sudo docker export jenkins-dv > /home/docker/docker-dv-backups/jenkins-dv.tar
    d) docker stop jenkins-app
    e) Remove the original jenkins data volume
       docker rm jenkins-dv
    f) import the backup of the data volume :
       sudo cat /home/docker/docker-dv-backups/jenkins-dv.tar | docker import - jenkins-dv-img:jenkins-dv-backup1
       (An image will be created called "jenkins-dv-img" and tagged as "jenkins-dv-backup1" from which to base the "jenkins-dv" container)
    g) Recreate the data volume container (NOTE: make sure you specify the same name "jenkins-dv" that the jenkins-app container expects)
       docker run -d -u root --name jenkins-dv jenkins
    g) Restart the jenkins-app container (NOTE: you do not need to include any of the switches and parameters made in the original run command that created the container - these are "stamped" into the container)
       docker restart jenkins-app
    h) Goto http://jenkinsvm and confirm you see the default page AND the jobs you created and plugins you loaded are still there.
