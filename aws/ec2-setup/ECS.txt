1) Create an IAM user that the AWS CLI is to use to access the AWS ECR (docker registry)
   http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-set-up.html#cli-signup
   a) Goto the IAM console
   b) Under IAM Resources, click "Users: 0"
   c) Click "Create New Users"
   d) Add a user "aws-cli-user"
   e) Save the access key id and the secret access key in a safe location.
   f) Under the "Permissions" tab, click "Attach Policy" and select "AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess"

2) Create the registry (ECR)
   a) go to:
      https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-east-1#/repositories
   b) Click "Get started" and type "kuali-research" for the repository name.
      Our AWS account is 730096353738, so this will make the URL for the repo: 
         https://730096353738.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/kuali-research
   c) Click "Done"
      This will produce a screen that shows examples of accessing the registry through the cli or docker:

         1) Retrieve the docker login command that you can use to authenticate your Docker client to your registry:
            aws ecr get-login --region us-east-1
         
         2) Run the docker login command that was returned in the previous step.
         3) Build your Docker image using the following command. For information on building a Docker file from scratch see the instructions here. You can skip this step if your image is already built:
            docker build -t kuali-research .
         
         4) After the build completes, tag your image so you can push the image to this repository:
            docker tag kuali-research:latest 730096353738.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/kuali-research:latest
         
         5) Run the following command to push this image to your newly created AWS repository:
            docker push 730096353738.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/kuali-research:latest      

3) Configure the AWS CLI on the jenkins server for the jenkins user.
   http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html
   a) sudo su jenkins
   b) aws configure
         AWS Access Key ID [None]: [access key ID]
         AWS Secret Access Key [None]: [secret key]
         Default region name [None]: us-west-2
         Default output format [None]: json
   c) test logging docker into the registry:
         eval $(aws ecr get-login --region [your region])
   d) test access to the registry by making a call with the registry api:
          aws ecr describe-repositories
