After shelling into ec2 instance with private key:

1)
   a) Create an SSH keypair for the EC2 instance

         ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -v
         name the key "mysql_ec2_id_rsa"
         leave passphrase blank

   b) Log into the AWS console
      Goto "Network & Security" --> "Key Pairs" and import the public key.

2) Log into the AWS console
   Goto "Network & Security" --> "Key Pairs" and import the public key(s).

3) Setup a security groups:
   a) "mysql-security-group"

      inbound:

         Type              Protocol   Port Range   Source

         All ICMP          All        N/A          0.0.0.0/0

         ---------------------------------------------------
         All traffic       All        All          0.0.0.0/0

3) Shell into the EC2 instance using private SSH key

4) sudo yum install mysql-server

5) Make mysql case insensitive (will be case sensitive with respect to table names because linux is a case-sensitive operating system)
   sudo vi /etc/my.cnf
   Add the following line:
      lower_case_table_names=1
   Save and restart the server

5) Configure the mysql service as a linux service that starts on boot and start the service

   sudo chkconfig mysqld on
   sudo service mysqld start

6) By default, the root user cannot connect remotely to the instance.
   Use workbench to tunnel into the instance over ssh on port 22 and connect to mysql "locally" with root

   Database --> Manage Connections --> New --> 

   Connection Method: Standard (TCP/IP)

   Parameters tab:
      SSH Hostname: ec2-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:22
      SSH Username: ec2-user
      SSH Password: none
      SSH Key File: [specify ssl key you use to shell into ec2 instance]
      MySQL Hostname: 127.0.0.1
      MySQL Server Port: 3306
      Username: root
      Password: none
   
   Test Connection: Should work   

7) Once connected to mysql through the tunnel, create another user with a password:

   CREATE USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'username'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
   CREATE USER 'username'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'username'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

8) Go back to workbench and create a connection for this new user

   Database --> Manage Connections --> New --> 

   Connection Method: Standard (TCP/IP)

   Parameters tab:
      Hostname: ec2-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
      Username: [name of new user]
      Password: Store in Vault... --> [password of new user]
   
   Test Connection: Should work   

9) If you want to give a password to the root user do the following: 

   mysqladmin -u root password [your_new_pwd]
