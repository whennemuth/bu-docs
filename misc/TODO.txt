   from there instead of the maven build job workspace folder.

3) Create a new job that pulls the most recent base images and 
   rebuilds and redeploys containers if the digest has changed.
   The redeploy should be optional via checkboxes for each 
   landscape.

   Include scenarios and how to accordingly set parameters.

5) Create documentation for all directories and resources to 
   monitor with regard to our cloud/container environments.

   variable for manual docker image builds. Push it to github and
   pull from github on each ec2 instance.

   apache branch and remove apache branch and update jenkins.

8) Resume work on Selenium-Test project.
