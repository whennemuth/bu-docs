kc-rice build issue

Hi team...

I am running into an issue that seems somewhat similar to:

   https://groups.google.com/a/kuali.org/forum/#!topic/kc.technical.collab/GG3ClEULN8U

I am running a jenkins build for kc-rice and have included the console out in an attached file.
What I am seeing is failure of spring-maven-plugin:3.1.0:load (metainf) on project rice-sql.
The load phase involves instantiation of a Project object that is loaded with properties using the spring PropertyPlaceholderHelper class.
This fails causing autowiring issues later on down the chain.

The offending code is on line 712 at:

   http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org.kuali.common/kuali-util/4.4.7/org/kuali/common/util/PropertyUtils.java

... leading to a problem at line 173 at:

   http://grepcode.com/file/repository.springsource.com/org.springframework/org.springframework.core/3.2.1/org/springframework/util/PropertyPlaceholderHelper.java

I notice that the value "1%/" is being used as the key for a property that cannot be found.
This seems fishy to me because I'd have expected a property placeholder key to include keys that are more human-readable, ie: ${project.java.version}

Initially, this error was triggered during the build of the very first submodule.
Then I followed the recommendation to cancel the augment/metainf phase in the similar issue referenced above and found that the first 4 or 5 submodules would now go through okay.
However, the rice-sql submodule build seems to ignore the this and proceeds with the metainf phase.
This is where the build stops.

   clean -e -X compile install -Dgrm.off=true -Dproject.augment.phase=none -Dproject.metainf.phase=none -Dmaven.test.skip=true

There was talk about using jdk8 being the potential cause, but we have now advanced and the build expects jdk 1.8 and won't like anything lower.

Does anyone see anything in the attached console output that would indicate what I'm doing wrong?

Any help would be much appreciated.
