1) cd [root of node application]

2) The conventional way of starting node would be to refer to an item in the scripts collection of package.json:

     npm myscript

   or directly...

     node dist/index.js

   to debug remotely using chrome, do this instead...

     node --inspect /var/core/dist/index.js
     or...
     npm chrome # where "chrome" is the name of a script in packages.json where the above command is referenced.

3) When node starts, the --inspect flag will cause it to output to the console a url that can be used in the 
   chrome browser to access the server for debugging info for the session. Example: 

     chrome-devtools://devtools/remote/serve_file/@60cd6e859b9f557d2312f5bf532f6aec5f284980/inspector.html?experiments=true&v8only=true&ws=127.0.0.1:9229/f6d1d89c-3a15-4441-8bd6-aeb25342fa19
   
   Paste this url to the clipboard.

4) Open chrome and paste the url from the clipboard into the navigation window and hit enter.
   A debugging screen should appear with a navigation frame displaying server content to the left.

5) Using the navigation frame, select a js file and place a breakpoint somewhere on the page where you expect execution to reach.
   Open up a new tab in chrome and navigate to a website location that should trigger the code with the breakpoint.
   You should see execution break at the breakpoint and you can step through the code from there.

SHORTCUT: Make an alias that cherry-picks the chrome debug link out of console output.
   The following example picks the url out of node console ouput running in a docker container:

     alias debuglink='docker logs core | grep "chrome-devtools" | tail -n1'
