Scenario: You want to restore the tip of a branch to what it was when 10 commits ago.
However, you have already pushed to other repos, so you don't want to use git reset.
Adding a new commit that duplicates that 10th commit can be done with git revert as follows:
(Assuming the branch we are interested in is master).

1) git checkout master
2) git checkout -b tempbranch
3) git checkout master
4) git reset --hard master~10
5) git merge --strategy=ours tempbranch
6) git branch -d tempbranch
