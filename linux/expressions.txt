# SCP example: Quick transfer of war files between servers:
# 1) Transfer private key to jenkins server from laptop.
scp -C -i /c/Users/wrh/.ssh/buaws-kuali-rsa /c/Users/wrh/.ssh/buaws-kuali-rsa wrh@10.57.236.6:/home/wrh/.ssh/
# 2) log into jenkins server and reduce permissions on the private key
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/buaws-kuali-rsa
# 3) From the jenkins server transfer the last built war file to another server (staging in this case)
scp -C -i ~/.ssh/buaws-kuali-rsa /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/kuali-research-1-build-war/coeus-webapp/target/coeus-webapp-1709.0037.war wrh@10.57.236.68:/home/wrh/
# 4) Remove the private key
rm -f ~/.ssh/buaws-kuali-rsa

# Get the number of files in a directory whose name(s) match a specified pattern ("*_rsa" in this case)
ls -1 *_rsa | wc -l
